# Exploratory Analysis in Health Comunication Web Application

Web application for exploratory data analysis. It was conceived for scientific use in the field of health communication. It's use was thought for reasearchers who do not know how to code, so they couldn't do any type of data analysis. Consequently, they would have to rely on softwares or others to do an analysis that they could've been doing for themselves if it wasn't the lack of knowladge on data analytics.

For now it only has basic an user-tweet-oriented analysis and pandas profile report, but new implementations are to come.
